**1) An overview of the function of the code (i.e., what it does and what it can be used for)**

The overview of the function of the code is that it is a Chrome extension that can provide summaries of the current browser tab and an interactive chat interface to ask questions. The applications can include being used to obtain quick summaries of online articles allowing users to digest information without having to read the entire text. This can be particularly beneficial to students who are studying for exams or reading notes/lectures. In addition, it provides a streamlined way of helping individuals synthesize information from long notes/instructions, or helping better understand information from webpages without having to go to other tabs and provide further queries in a search engine. The chat interface allows an active learning aid where the user can ask for followups to any information that is initially unclear. 

**2) Documentation of how the software is implemented with sufficient detail so that others can have a basic understanding of your code for future extension or any further improvement.**

The function of the code consists of two parts, the front-end and back-end. 

**Front-end**

Popup: The front end is a Chrome extension that is used to interact with a flask server running locally on http://127.0.0.1:5000/summary. The response from the flask API will be returned and then added to the display. The submit button when pressed will send the user input to http://127.0.0.1:5000/submit using a POST request which will clear the input field and display the userâ€™s question and add the response from the POST request. 

Backend: App is ran on http://127.0.0.1:5000. 

Summary Route POST Method: Extracts the URL from the request and calls the scrapeWebpage.py. scrapeWebpage.py. Extracts and process text by using tokenization and using stopword removal. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is then used to score for each word, and the top 50 words are choosen to be selected. This is used to provide summaries of only the most important content in the webpages as the OpenAI has limitations for the number of tokens allowed. 

Submit Route POST Method: Extracts the user input from the request data and then  Sends the input to GPT-3.5 using the openAI API. The response is then sent back to the client as a JSON. 

**3) Documentation of the usage of the software including either documentation of usages of APIs or detailed instructions on how to install and run a software, whichever is applicable.**

1. Git clone https://github.com/sd-20/SummarAIze.git
2. Make sure you have python3.5+
3. pip3 install -r requirements.txt

BACKEND
4. Add OpenAI API key into the app.py folder 
5. Run python src/backend/app.py from the root directory of SummarAIze 

FRONTEND
6. Manage Extensions in Google Chrome
7. Turn on Developer Mode
8. Download the SummarAIze main repo (Code -> Local -> Download ZIP -> unzip the folder) 
9. Click on Load Unpacked and select upload SummarAIze folder
10. Access Chrome Extension via SummarAIze icon
11. Open a new webpage then test it out 

**4) Brief description of contribution of each team member in case of a multi-person team. **

Sam - worked on the frontend, backend, and progress report. This involved helping implement the algorithm for the top 50 tokens and building the chat interface in the front end. We also all worked on the progress report. 

Andrea - worked on the frontend, backend, and progress report. This involved helping implement the algorithm for the top 50 tokens and building the chat interface in the front end. We also all worked on the progress report. 

Alan - worked on the backend of the project helping with the information extraction and parsing, algorithm for the top 50 tokens, and openAI API calls. We also all worked on the progress report. 

Jalen - worked on the backend of the project helping with the information extraction and parsing, algorithm for the top 50 tokens, and openAI API calls. We also all worked on the progress report.
