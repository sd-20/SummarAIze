# Proposal

## What are the names and NetIDs of all your team members? Who is the captain? The captain will have more administrative duties than team members.

- **Samuel Du** (sydu2, **Team Captain**)
- **Andrea Zhou** (andreaz3)
- **Jalen Xing** (jalenx2)
- **Alan Zhang** (alanyz2)

## What topic have you chosen? Why is it a problem? How does it relate to the theme and to the class?

### Theme 1: Intelligent Browsing

**What topic have you chosen?**  
We propose to create a browser extension that summarizes web pages by connecting with the OpenAI API and allows users to ask questions about the content of the pages.

**Why is it a problem?**  
The current browsers are great for quickly finding or saving information, but they lack "intelligence". Adding more intelligence to such browsers can turn a browser into a personal intelligent assistant that can broadly impact many users, potentially transforming how they access information on the entire Web.

**How does it relate to the theme and to the class?**  
This would allow users to leverage the power of generative AI to extract relevant information from a web page quickly, and view/ingest it in an interactive way by asking questions about it.

## Briefly describe any datasets, algorithms, or techniques you plan to use.

We plan to use the OpenAI API, which allows us to access intelligent AI models that can respond to questions in natural language and summarize text. We wonâ€™t be using any specific datasets per se, as our project has the flexibility to process any text data using the OpenAI API. The summarization technique we plan to use is abstractive summarization, which generates new sentences to represent the most important information from the text.

## How will you demonstrate that your approach will work as expected?

We will use a human-involved feedback approach to assess the validity of summaries generated by SummarAIze on a variety of reasonable-length text documents. We will then ask users to ask questions and check that they are being answered to their satisfaction. We will conduct comprehensive user interface and user experience testing to ensure that our Chrome extension is intuitive and visually appealing, iterating on any feedback.

## Which programming language do you plan to use?

- **Backend**: Python
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Please justify that the workload of your topic is at least 20*N hours, N being the total number of students in your team.

For our team of 4 members, the project workload:

- **Setting up Chrome Extension Framework**:
  - Tasks: Design basic structure, secure permissions, and ensure cross-version compatibility.
  - Estimated Time: 20 hours

- **Integration with OpenAI API**:
  - Tasks: Establish API communication, optimize response handling, and develop robust error management systems.
  - Estimated Time: 20 hours

- **Interactive User Interface Design**:
  - Tasks: Design an intuitive UI for displaying summaries, implement dynamic Q&A modules, and incorporate user preferences/settings.
  - Estimated Time: 20 hours

- **Thorough Testing & Iterative Feedback**:
  - Tasks: Deploy beta versions, collate user feedback, and initiate iterative improvements based on feedback.
  - Estimated Time: 30 hours

**Total Estimated Time**: 90 hours
